Objects and data structures in Python lie on a private heap. The Python memory manager internally manages this. 
It delegates some work to object-specific allocators while ensuring they operate only within the private heap. 
Actually, the interpreter manages this heap; the user has no control over it- not even if they manipulate object 
pointers to memory blocks inside the heap. The Python memory manager allocates heap space to objects and other 
internal buffers on demand.
