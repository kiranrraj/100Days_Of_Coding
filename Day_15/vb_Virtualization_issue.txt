Create a file, anywhere, using a text editor and copy the following into that file:
 pushd "%~dp0"
 dir /b %SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\*Hyper-V*.mum >hv.txt
 for /f %%i in ('findstr /i . hyper-v.txt 2^>nul') do dism /online /norestart /add-package:"%SystemRoot%\servicing\Packages\%%i"
 del hv.txt
 Dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Hyper-V -All /LimitAccess /ALL
 pause

Now save that as hv.bat from your text editor. The desktop or download folder are good destinations for which to save and easily located for the next step.
After exiting the editor, open file manager and right mouse click the file and choose run as administrator.
Once complete it will reboot your machine and you can turn on Hyper-v from programs and features.
